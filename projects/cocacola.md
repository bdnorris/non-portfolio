# Ozarkâ€™s Coca-Cola/Dr. Pepper

Ozark's Coca-Cola/Dr. Pepper Bottling Company needed a site refresh with an easier way to keep the homepage up to date with fresh content. A series of "card" style components were designed that could be created easily inside Wordpress. Because bottler's don't usually have access to a library of lifestyle photos, bottle and packaging art was utilized as the primary visual treatment.
